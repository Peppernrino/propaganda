What if the internet wasn't about connecting to Comcast, AT&T, Google, or Facebook? What if it meant connecting directly with your friends, neighbors, and community...? The Peoples Open Network enables anyone to share their Internet connection or extend a signal from neighboring nodes. Come over to the Omni Commons, on Sat. Jan. 27th, learn how the internet works and how to build your own. Meet and mingle with others interested in building neighborhood wireless networks. https://peoplesopen.net/workshop
