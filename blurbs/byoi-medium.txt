What if the internet wasn't about connecting to Comcast, AT&T, Google, or Facebook? 
What if it meant connecting directly with your friends, neighbors, and community...? 

Come over to the Omni Commons for the Build Your Own Internet (BYOI) workshop.
Let's discuss how the internet works, and how you can be part of the People's Open Network.

* No technical expertise needed. Technical curiosity very necessary. *

Agenda:           
 2:00pm - Introduction
 2:15pm - Panel discussion: Net neutrality is dead â€” or is it?
 3:00pm - Hands-on workshops and demos
 5:00pm - End / clean up
 
The Omni Commons Ballroom
4799 Shattuck, Oakland, CA    

The Omni Commons is 8 blocks (half of a mile) from MacArthur BART station, 2 blocks 
from AC transit, and substantial bike parking is available on sidewalk around the 
front of the building.

The venue is wheelchair-accessible. We ask attendees that they come to the event 
scent-free. The venue uses scent-free cleaning products but we unfortunately cannot 
make guarantees as various organizations and community members rent and come through the space.
