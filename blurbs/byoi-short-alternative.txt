What if the internet wasn't about connecting to Comcast, AT&T, Google, or Facebook? 
What if it meant connecting directly with your friends, neighbors, and community...? 
Let's discuss how the internet works,  how to build your own, and talk about existing community network projects (http://buildyourowninter.net) like the Oakland-based People's Open Network (https://peoplesopen.net).
Build Your Own Internet Workshop @OmniCommons 27 Jan 2-5pm.  Meet & mingle with others interested in building neighborhood wireless networks. https://peoplesopen.net/workshop
