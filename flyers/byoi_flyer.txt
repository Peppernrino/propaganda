Build Your Own Internet

What if the internet wasn't about connecting to Comcast, AT&T, Google, or Facebook? 
What if it meant connecting directly with your friends, neighbors, and community...?

The Peoples Open Network enables anyone to share their Internet connection or extend signal from neighboring nodes.

Come over to the Omni Commons for the Build Your Own Internet (BYOI) workshop!
Let's discuss how the internet works,  and how you can be part of the People's Open Network.

* No technical expertise needed. Technical curiosity very necessary. *
