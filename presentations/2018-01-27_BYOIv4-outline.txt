riotcon / byoi outline  

1. intro and appreciation - (slide 1: swag Omni Commons/Sudo Room/Sudo Mesh etc)    
Thanks for joining and for those at omnicommons, sudoroom and sudomesh for providing a space for creative collaborative thinking and doing.

2. state intentions -    
 I believe that by openly building, operating, and using, communal networks, we empower ourselves to create a more equal (digital) future. I'd like to share some of my experiences and would like to hear how you'd like to get involved.

3. motivation -

Would you trust a single, unelected person to act as a for-profit mediator between 2B humans? 

Would you apply a single youtwitface (i.e. youtube, twitter, facebook conglomerate envisioned by AdBusters and others) filter to our collective memory to optimize ad-clicks? 

How can you create an alternate, more open and communal digital future? 

How can we realize a future with open community internet access for individuals beyond the ISP monopolies that exists today? 

How does a system that was designed to be distributed and resilient against major outages (e.g., nuclear attack) turn into a network that relies on a few central players?

4. realizing a communal digital future -
get motivated
do things
meet at a place
share what you've done
repeat

5. do things - (slide 2: composite of omnicommons building, github repo, openwrt, design diagrams, legal docs, project websites) 
organize events (workshops, meetings)    
run a non-profit (legal, financial, admin)    
communicate (websites, swag, wikis, (inter-) national meetings)    
write open source software (firmware, back-end infrastructure)    
operate a local internet (keep things up and running)   

6. meet at a place 
Tuesday 7:30p meetings 
Sunday node mounts 
Monthly-ish workshops 
... mostly at 4799 Shattuck Ave, North Oakland at Sudo Room / Omni Commons.  


7. initiatives - (slide 3: how to entities/projects relate, optional slides per project)    
People's Open Network (https://peoplesopen.net) - open access community mesh network (mostly) in East Bay    
Sudo Mesh - non-profit, legal entity and development team software-hardware group (too vague?)     - non-profit, legal entity, development team? it's tough to explain sudomesh's existence, a bit convoluted, but important? - grnt

Build Your Own Internet (http://buildyourowninter.net) - a workshop series and a collaborative network-netural information resource -grnt

9. Closing: repeat intentions

10. Thanks for listening and prompt for discussion: 
How would you build your own internet? Where would you start? Who would you ask for help?
