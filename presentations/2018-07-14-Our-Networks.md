### Two Styles of European CNs

<br></br>

#### Federated and peer-produced

---

### Federated CNs

* Cooperative governing body, legal entity for network
* Member collectives/companies provide services
* Maintained by volunteers and professionals 
* Shared belief in _the commons_
<br></br>
* Examples: Guifi, Federation French Data Network (FFDN)

---
## guifi.net
* Started in early 2000s
* Federated under Guifi Foundation in 2008
* 26 companies provide services on the network
* Currently over 32,000 active nodes
* Mostly located in Catalonia [[3]]

<!--
---
## FFDN
* grew out of FDN which began operation in 1992
* Federated in 2010
* 26 companies act as service providers
* 9 working groups develop and maintain network
* began as ADSL provider
-->

---

### Peer-Produced CNs
* Loose associations of small networks
* Unifying principles, technologies
* Rooted in hacker/hobbyist communities
* Fully flat, volunteer organized
* Value _peer-production_ over ideology of _the commons_
<br></br>
* Examples: Freifunk, Funkfeuer, Ninux

---

### Freifunk
* Began in 2002
* Developers of batman-adv, enables Layer 2 routing
* More than 400 communities
* largest include,   
Muenster (>4000 nodes)  
Aachen (2000)  
Munich (1657)  
Stuttgart (1335) [[3]]

---
### North American CNs

<br></br>

#### are...all over the place...
<!--
we tried to classify them, 
they all fall somewhere between non-profit WISP and community organized 
-->
<!--
### Wireless ISP CNs
* Non-profit entities
* Almost all volunteer
* Seek to replace incumbent, for-profit ventures
* Similar technologies, methodolgies as for-profit WISPs
* Examples: NYCmesh, PittMesh
could even include for-profit companies that could spin into worker-owned cooperatives
-->

---

### NYCmesh

* First public node in 2014
* 185 active nodes
* Non-profit project of Internet Society (ISOC-NY)
* Operate two 'supernodes' in Manhattan and Brooklyn 

---

### PittMesh

* Began in 2013
* 67 active nodes
* Volunteer project under auspices of MetaMesh
* Donated time, to gain experience
* Compensated for-profit work, subsidizes non-profit efforts

---

### Detroit Community Technology Project (DCTP)
* started in 2012 with stimulus funding
* collaboration of Allied Media, Open Technology Institute
* spawned...  
Equitable Internet Initiative (EII)   
CassCo WiFi   
Digital Stewards Training
<br></br>

---
### Red Hook WiFi
* Inspired by DCTP
* 15 active nodes in Brooklyn, NY
* No longer holding regular meetings
* Trouble maintaining Digital Stewards training

---
### Latin American Alternative
<br></br>
#### Cooperative, communal, disaster-resilient, and _sometimes_ underground

Examples: Street Net (Cuba), Network Bogota, AlterMundi

---
### Street Net (SNET)

---

### AlterMundi

* Started in 2012
* Grassroots organization 
* Bottom-up approach to deal with communal problems
* Most members belong to QuintanaLibre CN, in Cordoba
* Developers of LibreMesh firmware

---
### Community Networks are

#### infrastructure that is _owned, created, managed, maintained, used and expanded_ __by__ a community

<br></br>
#### infrastructure that __serves__ a community...
#### and that __may or may not be__ _managed, owned, created, maintained and used_ by the community.

---
## Community Networks are

### _collective goods_,   
### _socially produced_,   
#### governed as _common-pool resources_. [[2]]

##### ~ Leonardo Navarro, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya
---
## Stable Networks are
#### collective goods __shared freely or 'at cost'__,   
#### socially produced __and continuously replenished__,   
#### governed __democratically__ as common-pool resources __ that are utilized sustainably__. 

---
### A pratical approach to stability

1. _community involvement_
2. _sustainability_
3. _training_
4. _use_
5. _robustness_
<br></br>
__in that order__
<br></br>

##### ~ Nicolas Pace, organizer, AlterMundi
---
### A more pratical approach to stability
* __have fun__

<div>
</div>

1. _community involvement_
2. _sustainability_
3. _training_
4. _use_
5. _robustness_
<br></br>
__in that order__
